spotify-api-project
===================

Uses the Spotify API to make a simple Python matplotlib graph of the songs added in your Spotfiy account. 

Create a new app in your [Spotify developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/) and add Client ID, Client Secret, URI, and token URL in the config.ini file. The graph will be generated as MusicTimeline.png in your project directory.

```
$ python main.py -u [SPOTIFY_USERNAME]
```
