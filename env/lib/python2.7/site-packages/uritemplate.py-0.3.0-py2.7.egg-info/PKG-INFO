Description: uritemplate
        ===========
        
        Documentation_ -- GitHub_ -- BitBucket_ -- Travis-CI_
        
        Simple python library to deal with `URI Templates`_. The API looks like
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from uritemplate import URITemplate, expand
        
            gist_uri = 'https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}'
            t = URITemplate(gist_uri)
            print(t.expand(gist_id=123456))
            # => https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists/123456
        
            # or
            print(expand(gist_uri, gist_id=123456))
        
            # also
            t.expand({'gist_id': 123456})
            print(expand(gist_uri, {'gist_id': 123456}))
        
        Where it might be useful to have a class
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import requests
        
            class GitHubUser(object):
                url = URITemplate('https://api.github.com/user{/login}')
                def __init__(self, name):
                    self.api_url = url.expand(login=name)
                    response = requests.get(self.api_url)
                    if response.status_code == 200:
                        self.__dict__.update(response.json())
        
        When the module containing this class is loaded, ``GitHubUser.url`` is 
        evaluated and so the template is created once. It's often hard to notice in 
        Python, but object creation can consume a great deal of time and so can the 
        ``re`` module which uritemplate relies on. Constructing the object once should 
        reduce the amount of time your code takes to run.
